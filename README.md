# What is github?
  - GitHub:
      * GitHub is like a social network for programmers and a place to store and collaborate on code.
      * Imagine it as a big platform where people can share, contribute to, and work together on software projects.
      * You can upload your code there, track changes, and work with others to build cool software.
      *  It's like a community center for coders.
   
  - Bitbucket
      * Bitbucket is another place where programmers can store and work on their code, a bit like GitHub.
      * Think of it as a tool that helps developers manage and organize their projects.
      *  It's like a workshop where you can build software with your team, keep track of your code changes, and make sure everything works smoothly.
